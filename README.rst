Just illustrating how ternry Boolean should behave
**************************************************

In electronics we have 3 states : 

* HV : High Voltage which is True
* LV : Low Voltage wich is Fale
* Z : high impendance or undefined. 

This is useful for protocol like I2C since it enables bi-directional communications on a single wire. 

Is there a use for Z in CS ? 
****************************

Well, knowing that a boolean equation has a solution whatever the input is can be nice. 

At least it is consistent.
